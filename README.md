# twitch-banner

How to use:
If you are on Linux its quite easy.
Install node.js then in terminal
> npm install twitch-js

And then add the required info to the script. That is oauth key, twitch username, name of the channel. All in lowercase letters.
Now just add the full path to the json file in the script.
And now just run this in terminal in the same folder as where the script is

> node TwitchBanner.js

For windows things are pretty similar. Just that instead of terminal you will use command line.
Windows for now does not have any integrated package manager like Linux so you will have to
download node.js and install it the "normal way".
There are many guides on how to do that.
The rest of the guide is identical to the linux guide.

I use Linux only and thus do not have a way to test it on Windows.
If someone gets it to work on Windows in some very simple way please do a Pull Request creating a detailed guide :)
